<meta name="description" content="An earlier article explained how to use self-hosted Azure DevOps agents to build and deploy your applications to a web app that has Private Endpoints enabled, or an ILB ASE. If you didn’t read that article, the TL;DR is that Private Endpoints blocks inbound access to your web app from the public internet. Private Endpoints is great for securing internal-facing applications without deploying an App Service Environment, but it means that you cannot directly publish your code to the web app from your local machine or Continuous Integration pipeline because that traffic is blocked. The earlier article shows how to deploy Azure DevOps build agents onto Virtual Machine Scale Sets in your Azure VNet. Those agents can publish to the web app since the deployment is sent from within the virtual network, not over the public internet.Solution OverviewThis article shows how to deploy to a Private Endpoint-enabled site from a Continuous Integration pipeline (such as GitHub Actions, Circle CI, Jenkins, or Travis CI) without having to self-host the CI service on a VM. Since Private Endpoints disables all inbound traffic from the internet, our CI pipeline will publish the files to a storage account and give the web app a SAS URL to files. Once the web app is given this SAS URL, it will pull the files from the storage account.We will use GitHub Actions as the CI system to demonstrate this solution, but the same pattern can be applied to other CI providers as well. If you are not familiar with GitHub Actions, please refer to the docs. If you are using a different CI system, simply copy the Azure CLI commands at the bottom, and use them in your CI provider.GitHub Actions workflowThe workflow has two jobs. The first builds and tests the application and uploads the artifact for the second job. Once the artifact is built, tested and uploaded, the second job pulls the artifact and runs an Azure CLI script to publish the files to an Azure Storage Account. Once the files are uploaded, we generate a SAS URL for the storage container with an expiration of 30-minutes. (This means the URL will be invalid 10 minutes after creation.) The web app then pulls the application from the storage account and deploys it. Behind the scenes, the Azure CLI commands are using ZIP deploy to publish the application. Once your code is deployed to the web app, a final CLI command deletes the storage container that contained the ZIP file.Note: A bug has been identified in the CLI command used in the GitHub Actions workflow below and a fix is underway. In the meantime, you can accomplish the same result by using az rest to send the deployment request directly to the ARM API. Example:az storage blob upload --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -f app.zipAPP_URL=$(az storage blob generate-sas --full-uri --permissions r --expiry $EXPIRY --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -n app.zip | xargs)az rest --method PUT \        --uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/${WEBAPP}/extensions/onedeploy?api-version=2020-12-01 \        --body &#39;{             &quot;properties&quot;: {                 &quot;properties&quot;: {                    &quot;packageUri&quot;: &quot;&#39;&quot;${APP_URL}&quot;&#39;&quot;                },                 &quot;type&quot;: &quot;zip&quot;,            }        }&#39;name: Deploy web app via Storage Accounton:  push:    branches: [ main, master ]  workflow_dispatch:env:  WEBAPP: your-webapp-name  GROUP: your-resource-group-name  ACCOUNT: name-for-storage-acct  # Does not have to exist, this will be created for you  CONTAINER: name-for-storage-container  EXPIRY_TIME: 10 minutesjobs:  build:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:    - uses: actions/checkout@v2        - name: Set up JDK 1.8      uses: actions/setup-java@v1      with:        java-version: 1.8            - name: Build with Maven      run: mvn package          - name: Upload artifact for deployment jobs      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2      with:        name: app        path: target/app.jar    publish:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    needs: build        steps:      - name: Azure Login        uses: azure/login@v1        with:          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}                - name: Download artifact        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2        with:          name: app            - name: Zip the app contents        uses: papeloto/action-zip@v1        with:          files: app.jar          dest: app.zip      - name: Set SAS token expiration        run: echo &quot;expiry=`date -u -d &quot;$EXPIRY_TIME&quot; &#39;+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ&#39;`&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV      - name: Azure CLI script        uses: azure/CLI@v1        with:          azcliversion: 2.19.1          inlineScript: |            az extension add --name webapp            az storage account create   -n $ACCOUNT   -g $GROUP -l westus            az storage container create -n $CONTAINER --account-name $ACCOUNT            az storage blob upload      -f app.zip    --account-name $ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -n $ACCOUNT            ZIP_URL=$(az storage blob generate-sas --full-uri --permissions r --expiry ${{ env.expiry }} --account-name $ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -n $ACCOUNT | xargs)            az webapp deploy --name $WEBAPP --resource-group $GROUP --type zip --src-url  $ZIP_URL --async false            az storage container delete -n $CONTAINER --account-name $ACCOUNT To use this workflow in your GitHub project, simply create an Azure Service Principal and save it as a secret named AZURE_CREDENTIALS in your repository. Finally, update the WEBAPP, CONTAINER, GROUP, and ACCOUNT environment variables with your desired resource names. By default, this workflow will run whenever a commit is pushed to the main or master branch. You can change this by updating the workflow triggers at the top of the yaml file. You can change the SAS token expiration time by changing the value of the EXPIRY_TIME variable at the top of the workflow.  The az webapp deploy command is in the webapps extension as of March 2021, it will be included in the core CLI in future release.Notes for other CI servicesNot using GitHub Actions? No problem! You can log into the Azure CLI using a Service Principal, just like on GitHub Actions, and use the Azure CLI commands at the bottom of the yaml file.

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Deploying to Network-secured sites, Part 2">
    <meta itemprop="description" content="An earlier article explained how to use self-hosted Azure DevOps agents to build and deploy your applications to a web app that has Private Endpoints enabled, or an ILB ASE. If you didn’t read that article, the TL;DR is that Private Endpoints blocks inbound access to your web app from the public internet. Private Endpoints is great for securing internal-facing applications without deploying an App Service Environment, but it means that you cannot directly publish your code to the web app from your local machine or Continuous Integration pipeline because that traffic is blocked. The earlier article shows how to deploy Azure DevOps build agents onto Virtual Machine Scale Sets in your Azure VNet. Those agents can publish to the web app since the deployment is sent from within the virtual network, not over the public internet.Solution OverviewThis article shows how to deploy to a Private Endpoint-enabled site from a Continuous Integration pipeline (such as GitHub Actions, Circle CI, Jenkins, or Travis CI) without having to self-host the CI service on a VM. Since Private Endpoints disables all inbound traffic from the internet, our CI pipeline will publish the files to a storage account and give the web app a SAS URL to files. Once the web app is given this SAS URL, it will pull the files from the storage account.We will use GitHub Actions as the CI system to demonstrate this solution, but the same pattern can be applied to other CI providers as well. If you are not familiar with GitHub Actions, please refer to the docs. If you are using a different CI system, simply copy the Azure CLI commands at the bottom, and use them in your CI provider.GitHub Actions workflowThe workflow has two jobs. The first builds and tests the application and uploads the artifact for the second job. Once the artifact is built, tested and uploaded, the second job pulls the artifact and runs an Azure CLI script to publish the files to an Azure Storage Account. Once the files are uploaded, we generate a SAS URL for the storage container with an expiration of 30-minutes. (This means the URL will be invalid 10 minutes after creation.) The web app then pulls the application from the storage account and deploys it. Behind the scenes, the Azure CLI commands are using ZIP deploy to publish the application. Once your code is deployed to the web app, a final CLI command deletes the storage container that contained the ZIP file.Note: A bug has been identified in the CLI command used in the GitHub Actions workflow below and a fix is underway. In the meantime, you can accomplish the same result by using az rest to send the deployment request directly to the ARM API. Example:az storage blob upload --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -f app.zipAPP_URL=$(az storage blob generate-sas --full-uri --permissions r --expiry $EXPIRY --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -n app.zip | xargs)az rest --method PUT \        --uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/${WEBAPP}/extensions/onedeploy?api-version=2020-12-01 \        --body &#39;{             &quot;properties&quot;: {                 &quot;properties&quot;: {                    &quot;packageUri&quot;: &quot;&#39;&quot;${APP_URL}&quot;&#39;&quot;                },                 &quot;type&quot;: &quot;zip&quot;,            }        }&#39;name: Deploy web app via Storage Accounton:  push:    branches: [ main, master ]  workflow_dispatch:env:  WEBAPP: your-webapp-name  GROUP: your-resource-group-name  ACCOUNT: name-for-storage-acct  # Does not have to exist, this will be created for you  CONTAINER: name-for-storage-container  EXPIRY_TIME: 10 minutesjobs:  build:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:    - uses: actions/checkout@v2        - name: Set up JDK 1.8      uses: actions/setup-java@v1      with:        java-version: 1.8            - name: Build with Maven      run: mvn package          - name: Upload artifact for deployment jobs      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2      with:        name: app        path: target/app.jar    publish:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    needs: build        steps:      - name: Azure Login        uses: azure/login@v1        with:          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}                - name: Download artifact        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2        with:          name: app            - name: Zip the app contents        uses: papeloto/action-zip@v1        with:          files: app.jar          dest: app.zip      - name: Set SAS token expiration        run: echo &quot;expiry=`date -u -d &quot;$EXPIRY_TIME&quot; &#39;+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ&#39;`&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV      - name: Azure CLI script        uses: azure/CLI@v1        with:          azcliversion: 2.19.1          inlineScript: |            az extension add --name webapp            az storage account create   -n $ACCOUNT   -g $GROUP -l westus            az storage container create -n $CONTAINER --account-name $ACCOUNT            az storage blob upload      -f app.zip    --account-name $ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -n $ACCOUNT            ZIP_URL=$(az storage blob generate-sas --full-uri --permissions r --expiry ${{ env.expiry }} --account-name $ACCOUNT -c $CONTAINER -n $ACCOUNT | xargs)            az webapp deploy --name $WEBAPP --resource-group $GROUP --type zip --src-url  $ZIP_URL --async false            az storage container delete -n $CONTAINER --account-name $ACCOUNT To use this workflow in your GitHub project, simply create an Azure Service Principal and save it as a secret named AZURE_CREDENTIALS in your repository. Finally, update the WEBAPP, CONTAINER, GROUP, and ACCOUNT environment variables with your desired resource names. By default, this workflow will run whenever a commit is pushed to the main or master branch. You can change this by updating the workflow triggers at the top of the yaml file. You can change the SAS token expiration time by changing the value of the EXPIRY_TIME variable at the top of the workflow.  The az webapp deploy command is in the webapps extension as of March 2021, it will be included in the core CLI in future release.Notes for other CI servicesNot using GitHub Actions? No problem! You can log into the Azure CLI using a Service Principal, just like on GitHub Actions, and use the Azure CLI commands at the bottom of the yaml file.

<p>To use this workflow in your GitHub project, simply <a href="https://github.com/azure/login#configure-deployment-credentials">create an Azure Service Principal</a> and save it as a secret named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AZURE_CREDENTIALS</code> in your repository. Finally, update the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WEBAPP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONTAINER</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GROUP</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACCOUNT</code> environment variables with your desired resource names. By default, this workflow will run whenever a commit is pushed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch. You can change this by updating the workflow triggers at the top of the yaml file. You can change the SAS token expiration time by changing the value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXPIRY_TIME</code> variable at the top of the workflow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/webapp/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#ext_webapp_az_webapp_deploy"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">az webapp deploy</code></a> command is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webapps</code> extension as of March 2021, it will be included in the core CLI in future release.</p>

<p>Not using GitHub Actions? No problem! You can log into the Azure CLI using a Service Principal, just like on GitHub Actions, and use the Azure CLI commands at the bottom of the yaml file. We have compiled some helpful resources for common CI providers below.</p>
