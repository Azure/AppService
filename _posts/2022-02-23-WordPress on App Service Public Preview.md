We are happy to announce the availability of the public preview of the [WordPress offering on AppService](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/WordPress.WordPress). This offering will enable you to deploy and host new WordPress websites with ease.

Check out the following docs to learn more about deploying a WordPress website on AppService: [Quickstart: Create a WordPress site - Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-wordpress)

The latest update provides you with four hosting plans:

1. Basic: Use this plan if you are setting up a blog or a portfolio website as a hobby or if you are just trying to learn WordPress.
2. Development: Use this plan if you are an advanced user of WordPress and want to develop WordPress websites.
3. Standard: Use this plan for general purpose production applications.
4. Premium: Use this plan for heavy workload production applications.

WordPress installation is now simpler. You just have to input the admin email, username, and password and everything else is taken care of.

The latest update also brings significant performance enhancements like integrated caching and image compression.
