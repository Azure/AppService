We have completed the rollout for [.NET 9 GA](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) support on Azure App Service.

Like in previous years we are using the [App Service Early Access feature](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access) to enable day-0 support on the platform across all public regions on Azure App Service for Windows. The early access release will be followed by additional deployments to fully integrate the new bits across our fleet, expecting to be fully done by the end of the week.

On Azure App Service for Linux, .NET 9 GA will be fully integrated on day-0 across all public regions without any additional deployments.

If you already have an app targeting an earlier preview of .NET 9.0 on the platform for App Service for Windows, you would need to redeploy the application after updating your [runtimeconfig.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) to use .NET 9.0.0.

For Azure App Service for Linux, if you already have an app targeting an earlier preview of .NET 9.0 on the platform, there is no need to take action as the new runtime will be picked up on the next application restart once the update is available for your app. You can trigger this manually by stopping and starting your app.

Self-contained .NET apps will *not* be auto-updated since they have no dependency on the runtime provided by App Service.

Azure Functions and Azure Static Webapps are also enabling .NET 9 workloads across their scenarios.
