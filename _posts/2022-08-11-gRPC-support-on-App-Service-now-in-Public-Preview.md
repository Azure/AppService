We are pleased to announce that gRPC (public preview) is now available in [most regions](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/tree/master/HowTo/gRPC#grpc-on-app-service).  gRPC is supported for Linux applications using .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 6.  Node support is coming soon (9/1/22).    


Please visit this tutorial [How-To deploy a .NET 6 gRPC app on App Service](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/HowTo/gRPC/use_gRPC_with_dotnet.md#how-to-deploy-a-net-6-grpc-app-on-app-service) to try out gRPC on App Service today.
