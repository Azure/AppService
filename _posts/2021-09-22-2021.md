App Service Domain is a domain resource on Azure which integrates with Azure DNS. This allows you to manage all your resources on Azure for when you need to get your web app up and runing. 

## Purchasing an App Service Domain

Refer to the docs on [how to purchase an App Service Domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain#buy-an-app-service-domain).

## Managing DNS

An Azure DNS resource also gets created with your App Service Domain by default. You can use your Azure DNS to manage the DNS of your domain.

## Exceptions for transfering domain out

You won't be able to transfer your domain within 60 days of these events:

1. New domain registration
1. Transfer between different registrars
1. Change to registrant contact information

## What is an authorization code?

The authorization code is a unique string of characters consisting of letters, numbers, and special characters (ie. ? ! ^) that is required to transfer a domain from one registrar to another.

## Transfering domain out

Transfering of domain out of Azure (not a registrar) to another registrar is supported and you may currently do so via CLI and API. You will need to get an authorization code which you can take to the registrar of choice to proceed with transfering out of your domain.

There are a few ways to get the authorization:


### Transfer out API

You can use the transfer out API:

``` 
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME>/providers/Microsoft.DomainRegistration/domains/<DOMAIN-NAME>/transferout?api-version=2021-02-01
```

You may be able to run this API on [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com/raw/). Fill out the necessary information in between the "<" and ">" from the above, then paste the API call to you Azure Resource Explorer. Highlight the entire line from "PUT" until "api-version=2021-02-01" and hit Ctrl+S to run the command. You would expect similar results from the image below.

Refer to the "authCode" value without the double quotes ("). This will be the authorization code you will need to provide the new domain registrar to transfer your domain out.

### Powershell

There currently is no first class Powershell support for domain transfer out. However, you can use the following call below to get your authorization code:

``` PS
Invoke-AzRestMethod -Path "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME>/providers/Microsoft.DomainRegistration/domains/<DOMAIN-NAME>/transferout?api-version=2021-02-01" -Method PUT
```
Refer to the "authCode" value without the double quotes ("). This will be the authorization code you will need to provide the new domain registrar to transfer your domain out.

### Cloudshell
If you are having issues running the command in your local PowerShell, try using Cloud Shell on Azure Portal instead. You can access Cloud Shell on the top right navigation on Azure Portal. Once the Cloud Shell windows appear, check the top left corner of the window and make sure it says "PowerShell" and not "Bash"; otherwise, switch to "PowerShell". Copy paste the command above and fill out the necessary information in between the "<" and ">", then press enter.

## Transfering domain in

Transfering of domain into Azure is currently not supported. Any attempts made to transfer the domain into Azure risks getting the domain at a broken state. We will not be providing support to fix domains caught in this broken state due to transfer in.
