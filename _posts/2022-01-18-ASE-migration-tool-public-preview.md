We are happy to announce the availability of the public preview of the [App Service Environment (ASE) v3 migration tool](https://aka.ms/asemigration). With this tool, you'll be able to migrate your existing ASE as well as the apps running on that ASE to [ASEv3](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/overview). ASEv3 provides a number of [feature differences](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/overview#feature-differences) as well as performance enhancements and [potential reduced overall costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/overview#pricing) compared to previous versions. To get a complete overview on ASEv3, read the ASEv3 focused [App Service Environment overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/overview).

Check out the following docs to learn more about migrating to ASEv3:

- [Migrate to App Service Environment v3](https://aka.ms/asemigration)
- [How to Migrate to ASEv3](https://aka.ms/asemigrationhowto)

> **NOTE**  
> At this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time using the tool and stay tuned for updates as we release additional capabilities.
>

An Azure portal experience for migration will be available at the start of February, 2022. Be on the lookout for additional announcements.

If your ASE [isn't supported for migration](https://aka.ms/asemigration#preview-limitations) using the migration tool and your ASE isn't listed under one of the [upcoming supported scenarios](https://aka.ms/asemigration#preview-limitations), you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually. See the [migration alternatives](https://aka.ms/asemigrationalternatives) for more details.
