We are happy to announce the availability of the public preview of the [App Service Environment (ASE) v3 migration tool](pending link). With this tool, you'll be able to automatically migrate your existing ASE as well as the apps running on that ASE to [ASEv3](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/overview). ASEv3 provides a number of [feature differences](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/overview#feature-differences) as well as performance enhancements and [reduced overall costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/overview#pricing) compared to previous versions.

Check out the following docs to learn more:

[How to Migrate](pending link)

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time.
>

If your ASE [isn't supported for migration](pending link) using the migration tool and your ASE isn't listed under one of the [upcoming supported scenarios](pending link), you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually. See the [migration alternatives](pending link) for more details.
