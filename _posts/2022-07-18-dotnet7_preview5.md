# .NET 7 Preview 5 on App Service
  
We are happy to announce that App Service now supports apps targeting [.NET 7 Preview 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) across all public regions and scenarios on both Windows and Linux App Service plans through the [App Service Early Access feature](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access).

[Azure Functions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2201098) has also added initial support for .NET 7 Preview 5.

Any app targeting the .NET 7 on App Service during the preview stages will be automatically updated to the latest .NET 7 Preview releases as they become available all the way up to RC and GA. 

Self contained apps will not be auto-updated since they have no dependency on the runtime provided by App Service.
