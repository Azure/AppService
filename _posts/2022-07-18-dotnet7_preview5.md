We are happy to announce that App Service now supports apps targeting [.NET 7 Preview 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) across all public regions on both Windows and Linux App Service Plans through the [App Service Early Access feature](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access).

[Azure Functions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2201098) has also added initial support for .NET 7 Preview 5.

Any app targeting the .NET 7 on App Service during the preview stages will be automatically updated to the latest .NET 7 Preview release as newer releases become available. This update process will continue all the way up to the RC and GA releases. 

Self-contained .NET apps will *not* be auto-updated since they have no dependency on the runtime provided by App Service.
