In November 2024, we announced the [General Availability (GA) of the Sidecar feature for Azure App Service for Linux](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-sidecar-extensibility-in-azure-app-servic/4267985), enabling developers to run sidecar containers alongside their applications. Today, we're excited to take this capability even further with the introduction of **Sidecar Extensions**—pre-packaged integrations that simplify common use cases and accelerate development.  

## What Are Sidecar Extensions?  

Sidecar Extensions allow you to easily add common integrations to your web applications. With just a few configurations, you can enhance your applications with capabilities like caching, observability, and AI-powered enhancements.  

The first set of Sidecar Extensions available today includes:  

- **Phi-4 & Phi-3** – Leverage Microsoft's small language models (SLMs) for AI-powered text generation, summarization, and more.  
- **Redis** – Improve performance with an in-memory caching solution.  
- **Datadog** – Enhance observability and monitoring with seamless integration to Datadog’s APM and logging solutions.  

## Get Started with Sidecar Extensions  

Getting started with Sidecar Extensions is simple. You can enable and configure these extensions through the Azure portal, CLI, or ARM templates.
