Last year, we introduce [Webjobs on Linux](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2024/04/04/Public-Preview-Sidecars-Webjobs.html)  as a preview feature.  We are now excited to annouce **General Avilability** for Webjob on App Service Linux for both  code an containers scenarios.

Webjobs enable the execution of background tasks and scheduled processes, which, unlike traditional web applications, are not triggered by an HTTP request.

You can learn more about Webjobs in our documentation: [Run background tasks with WebJobs in Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create?tabs=linuxcode).

You can also watch a our demo during this week's [Azure Developers Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP5NjMAzKPg), where we combine webjobs and  [sidecars](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/03/19/phi-sidecar-extension.html) to modernize an existing application with AI capabilities using a Small Language Model.
