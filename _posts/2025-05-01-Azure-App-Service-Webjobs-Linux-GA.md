Last year we introduce [Webjobs on Linux](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2024/04/04/Public-Preview-Sidecars-Webjobs.html)  as a preview feature and we are now excited to annouce **General Avilability** for Webjob on App Service Linux for both  code an containers scenarios.

Webjobs allow for the execution of background tasks and scheduled processes, that unlike traditional web applications are not triggered by an HTTP request.

You can learn more about Webjobs in our docs: [Run background tasks with WebJobs in Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create?tabs=linuxcode).

You can also watch a our demo during this week's [Azure Developers Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP5NjMAzKPg) where we combine webjobs + sidecars to modernize an existing application and AI capabilities using a Small Language Model.
