We are happy to announce that App Service now supports apps targeting [Go 1.18 and 1.19](https://go.dev/dl/) across all public regions on Linux App Service Plans through the [App Service Early Access feature](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access). By introducing native support for Go on App Services, we are making one of the top 10 best loved web app development languages available for our developers.

Support for Go is being added as an Experimental feature. Experimental features are work in progress and can radically change or completely disappear at any time. You can use it if you're an early adopter, see something useful to you, and would like to help test the feature.
