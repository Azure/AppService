We are happy to announce that App Service is rolling out *day 0* support for **.NET 6.0** applications across all public regions and scenarios on both Windows and Linux App Service plans.

The App Service and .NET teams worked closely together to deliver this functionality on the same day as .NET 6.0 reached GA ([see .NET 6.0 GA announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/)). Day 0 support for .NET 6.0 GA delivers on the promise made last year during [.NET 5.0 GA announcement.](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2020/11/10/Dot-Net-5-on-App-Service.html)

Joining the party this year with *day 0* support are:

- [Azure Functions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2178604) where you can host serverless functions using Functions Runtime v4.
- [Azure Static Web Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2178605) that supports full-stack .NET 6.0 applications with Blazor WebAssembly frontends and Azure Functions APIs.

To achieve *day 0* support across all scenarios we continue to leverage the **Early Access** mechanism to seed and distribute the new runtime globally: [Learn more about App Service Early Access.](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access). The early access release will be followed by additional deployments to fully integrate the new bits across our fleet expecting to be fully done by the end of the week.

If you already have an app targeting and earlier preview of .NET 6.0 on the platform, there is no need to take action as the new runtime will be picked up on the next application restart once the update is available for your app. You can trigger this manually by starting and stopping your app.

If you want to learn more, be sure to checkout our session during [.NET Conf 2021](https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda). Wednesday 11/10 @ 9:30am PST [@bktv99](https://twitter.com/bktv99) will be taking the stage to show you "6 ways to get started with .NET 6.0 and App Service".
