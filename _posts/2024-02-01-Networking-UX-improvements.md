We have gradually been making improvements to the Azure portal experience for managing network configuration in App Service. In this blogpost I'll go through some highlights that you may or may not have noticed.

## Overview page

On the overview page that you land on when opening an App Service app in the Azure portal, we have added some essential Networking info and provided "deep links". You can click the Networking header to go to the Networking hub and you can see you virtual network integration status and go directly to the configuration. You'll also see the IP configuration of your app.
