We are thrilled to announce that WordPress on App Service that was under public preview since February 15, 2022, is now generally available. With advanced features and revised hosting plans, you can now deploy and manage WordPress websites with ease. We have continued to make improvements in performance and security so that you can deliver a great experience to your customers.

We recommend that you use Linux for your WordPress server. PHP on Windows will not be officially supported on App Service Platform after November 25, 2022.
