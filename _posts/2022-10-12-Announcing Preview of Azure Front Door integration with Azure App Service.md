We are happy to announce the preview of [WordPress on Azure App Service](https://aka.ms/wpafd) powered by [Azure Front Door](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) which enables faster page loads, enhanced security, and increased reliability for your global apps with no configuration or additional code required. This integration help improve the site performance by delivering your content using Microsoft's global edge network with hundreds of global and local points of presence. Access to the static and dynamic content of your WordPress application is accelerated by caching static content at the edge server and using split TCP method to reduce connection establishment time among others.
