We are starting the rollout for [.NET 7 GA](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) support on App Service. Like in previous years we are using the [App Service Early Access feature](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access) to enable day-0 support on the platform across all public regions on both Windows and Linux App Service Plans. Early Access rollout is expected to complete later today (November 7, 2022). The early access release will be followed by additional deployments to fully integrate the new bits across our fleet expecting to be fully done by the end of the week.

If you already have an app targeting and earlier preview of .NET 7.0 on the platform, there is no need to take action as the new runtime will be picked up on the next application restart once the update is available for your app. You can trigger this manually by starting and stopping your app.

Self-contained .NET apps will *not* be auto-updated since they have no dependency on the runtime provided by App Service.

[Azure Functions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2214834) and [Azure Static Webapps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2215233) are also enabling .NET 7 workloads across their scenarios.
