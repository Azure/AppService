    Azure Marketplace is a hub of solutions for users to create different types of resources.  Each category of resource such as Data services, Virtual machines, Web have different on-boarding processes for ISVs to publish their solutions in Azure marketplace. In this article we will discuss the process to on-board Web Apps to Web Marketplace in Azure.

To showcase your application in Web Azure marketplace , you need to get your application certified. The certification process is a 5 Step process.

     Azure Web Marketplace Principles
    </h3>
    Users can browse and view applications for different types of Web sites, ranging from photo galleries to blogs to e-commerce sites. To be part of the Azure Web Marketplace, developers should follow these principles, which establish a consistent, quality user experience:
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Current
      </strong>
      : The application you provide a link to must be the latest, stable final release version available, hosted on a publicly available Web URL.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Application License
      </strong>
      : The application Azure Web Marketplace may provide an entry point
      <strong>
       <u>
        free of charge
       </u>
      </strong>
      or use
      <strong>
       <u>
        Bring your own license model (BOYL)
       </u>
      </strong>
      where users can purchase a license from the application publisher's website.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Compatible
      </strong>
      : The generated and configured application deployed from Azure Web Marketplace must also run on any Windows OS.The application should support running on cloud infrastructure by providing an option to make the application stateless.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Hostable
      </strong>
      : The application to which you provide a link must run well in a shared hosted environment as well as when the user has administrative rights for the computer.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Deployable
      </strong>
      : Your application code must be available on a public repository on Github.com . Azure users should be able to fork the repository and deploy to Azure web app.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Supported
      </strong>
      : You must provide a publicly available Web site where end users can download your application, find documentation and/or get free on a best effort basis support through a forum.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Platform Independent
      </strong>
      : The application to which you provide a link must be able to run on all Windows  platforms x86, and x64.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Inclusive
      </strong>
      : If your application is included in the Gallery, you should include a statement of availability in the Azure App Gallery on the application community’s Web site.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be Safe
      </strong>
      : The application to which you provide a link must not harm customers or be malicious, dishonest, destructive, invasive, or act in any manner restricted by the
      <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/submissionagreement.aspx">
       Web Gallery Application Submission agreement.
      </a>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Be a Web App
      </strong>
      : The application to which you provide a link must be a Web application that can be used to generate a working, usable Web site after deployment
      <em>
       without
      </em>
      requiring code or customization.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Support Database Dependencies:
      </strong>
      Currently our create experience supports Web App with Database ( MySQL and/or SQL DB). If your application has other dependencies , Web Marketplace may not be an option.You may want to look into
      <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/marketplace-publishing-solution-template-creation/">
       Azure solution templates.
      </a>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
     Package your application code
    </h3>
    <strong>
     Using Git Deploy:
    </strong>
    Create a public Github repository with your application code as it would be deployed under
    <em>
     wwwroot
    </em>
    in the Azure web app. You may include custom post deployment scripts with a
    <em>
     deploy.cmd
    </em>
    file in the root of your repository, see details on
    <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Custom-Deployment-Script">
     how to add custom scripts
    </a>
    .

This packaging method makes managing updates to your application easier without having to go through the entire certification process. For future updates to your application , you need to update the code in the repository with appropriate commit message for users to pull in to latest bits of your application. When code changes are committed to your repo  , the code is not automatically pulled in for users using your application to prevent breaking their application. Users using your application must perform a manual sync to pull in the latest committed changes from your repository.
    <div style="border: 1px solid black;padding: 10px">
     <em>
      Note: We are no longer supporting Web deploy method of application packaging for NEW applications in the Web marketplace.

    <h4 id="azurepackage">
     Building an Azure Package for Marketplace
    </h4>
    Azure Package has a special folder structure to be consumed by Azure Marketplace service. Each folder at the root level approximately represents a publisher. A folder contains one or more
    <code>
     .json
    </code>
    files, called package manifests, each of which contains the metadata for an Azure Gallery package. Every folder also includes a set of deployment templates, strings , icons and screenshots which can be referenced by the package manifests. See the folder structure shown below :
    <pre><code>/MyPackage/
/MyPackage/Manifest.json
/MyPackage/UIDefinition.json
/MyPackage/Icons/
/MyPackage/Screenshots/
/MyPackage/Strings/
/MyPackage/DeploymentTemplates/
</code></pre>
    You can find sample packages on
    <a href="https://github.com/SunBuild/web-app-marketplace">
     GitHub
    </a>
    .
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       <strong>
        Manifest.json:
       </strong>
      </strong>
      The manifest file contains all of the metadata for your gallery item. For a visual representation of where each metadata value is used , view the schema for
      <a href="https://github.com/SunBuild/web-app-marketplace/blob/master/Schema_Manifest.json">
       Manifest.json
      </a>
      . Add the paths to the Icons , Screenshots and links to articles that can help customers get more information about your application.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       UIDefinition.json :
      </strong>
      Use the
      <a href="https://github.com/SunBuild/web-app-marketplace/blob/master/schema_UIDefinition.json">
       UIDefintion.json schema
      </a>
      to build appropriate UIDefinition.json for your application. You can use "parameters" properties which is optional , if your application needs to ask the user for information for the deployment of your app. These parameters become AppSettings for your web app and can be consumed within your app as environment variables.To hide a parameter from the portal UI , set
      <em>
       "hidden":true
      </em>
      as show
      <a href="https://github.com/SunBuild/web-app-marketplace/blob/master/WebApp-CustomAppSettings-NoDatabase/UIDefinition.json#L35">
       here
      </a>
      . To mark a parameter as required for the create experience , set
      <em>
       "required":true
      </em>
      as shown
      <a href="https://github.com/SunBuild/web-app-marketplace/blob/master/WebApp-CustomAppSettings-NoDatabase/UIDefinition.json#L40">
       here
      </a>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Icons :
      </strong>
      The relative path specified by
      <code>
       iconPath
      </code>
      in a package manifest must point to a folder that includes the following four images with these dimensions mentioned below:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Small.png (40x40 px)
       </li>
       <li>
        Medium.png (90x90 px)
       </li>
       <li>
        Large.png (115x115 px)
       </li>
       <li>
        Wide.png (255x115 px)
       </li>
      </ul>
      You can group icons under sub-folders if you have different ones per product. Just be sure to include the sub-folder in the
      <code>
       iconPath
      </code>
      for the package manifest that uses them.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Screenshots :
      </strong>
      Images must be exactly 533px by 324px and in PNG format. Specifying a screenshot for a gallery package is completely optional, so do not feel compelled to include one unless it makes sense for your offering.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Deployment Templates :
      </strong>
      Include an ARM template that allows Azure users to deploy  the application via PowerShell. To learn how to build an ARM template , read the
      <span>
       guidelines stated
      </span>
