We are pleased to announce that gRPC is coming to Azure App Service for Linux workloads.

Using gRPC, you can utilize the remote procedure call framework to streamline messages between your client and server over HTTP/2. Using gRPC protocol over HTTP/2 enables the use of features like multiplexing to send multiple parallel requests over the same connection.

gRPC is currently available in EUAP with Private Preview for use with .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 6.


Please visit this tutorial [How-To deploy a .NET 6 gRPC app on App Service](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/HowTo/gRPC/use_gRPC_with_dotnet.md) to try out gRPC on App Service today.
